# Tailwind CSS To-Do List with Local Storage

This project is a simple To-Do List application built using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript, with styling done using Tailwind CSS. It allows users to create, update, and delete tasks, with the added functionality of storing tasks locally using the browser's Local Storage API.

## Features

1. **Add Tasks**: Users can easily add new tasks to the list by typing into the input field and pressing enter or clicking the add button.
2. **Update Tasks**: Tasks can be marked as complete by clicking on them. Completed tasks are visually distinguished from incomplete ones.
3. **Delete Tasks**: Users can remove tasks from the list by clicking the delete button associated with each task.
4. **Local Storage**: The application utilizes the browser's Local Storage to persist task data. This ensures that tasks remain saved even after the browser is closed or refreshed.
